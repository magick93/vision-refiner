# Product Guidelines

## Brand Messaging & Tone
The primary tone for all user interface interactions and external communications will be **Professional and Direct**. This approach emphasizes clarity, efficiency, and a focus on the technical capabilities and benefits of the vision refiner application. While maintaining a helpful demeanor, the language should be precise and avoid overly casual or overly innovative jargon where clarity would be compromised.

## Visual Identity
We will use https://www.shadcn-svelte.com components and style.
We do not want to spend time and effort designing a new style at this state

## User Experience (UX) Principles
User experience design will prioritize:
*   **Clarity:** Information and options should be easily understandable and accessible.
*   **Efficiency:** Streamlined workflows for image generation, analysis, and refinement. Use pre-built components for shadcn-svelte.
*   **Control:** Users should feel in command of the refining process, with clear feedback loops.
*   **Consistency:** A consistent interface and interaction patterns across the application.
* **

## Interaction Design
Interactions should be intuitive and responsive. Given the use of SvelteKit and XState, interactions should leverage a reactive and state-driven approach, providing immediate visual feedback to user actions and system processes (e.g., image generation progress, analysis completion).
